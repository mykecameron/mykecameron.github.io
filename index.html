          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer with 15 years experience building products and teams in health care and ecommerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have deep expertise in building scalable, maintainable, and error free software in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and
          a passion for developing and delivering solutions that delight users, colleagues, customers, and patients. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For over a decade I've been leveraging agile processes and scrum to help teams deliver real, observable results to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm looking for my next challenge! If you have an opportunity you think I might be excited about, please don't
