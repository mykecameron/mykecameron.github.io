          Software Engineer and Technical Leader
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineer and technical leader with over 15 years of experience in health care and 
          ecommerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leverage my deep experience in building scalable, maintainable, well tested, and error free software in Ruby, 
          Rails, Typescript, Javascript, React, and Ember to develop and deliver solutions that delight users and 
          business stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          I push my teams to higher levels of agility and faster delivery by applying hard earned lessons from over a 
          decade of process leadership in Scrum and Kanban teams. 
          
          I relish the opportunity to share my experience through mentorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love fast-paced startup environments, and helping grow organizations from infancy to maturity, with multiple
          successful startup exits under my belt as a founding employee of Springboard Retail
          <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/global-payments-acquires-springboard-retail-2--b175aca9">(acquired by Global Payments)</a>,
          and early employee of Iora Health (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/one-medical-is-buying-iora-health-2021-6">acquired by One Medical</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/business/amazon-one-medical-deal.html">later Amazon</a>). 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm looking for my next challenge! If you have an opportunity you think I might be excited about, please don't 
          hesitate to reach out!
