          Software Engineer and Technical Leader

        <p>
          Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am a Software Engineer and Technical leader with over 15 years of experience building products, teams, and processes in health tech and ecommerce startups.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leverage my deep experience in building scalable, maintainable, and error free software using tools like Ruby on Rails, React, EmberJS, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and OpenSearch, to deliver solutions that delight stakeholders, users, colleagues, customers, and patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          I push my teams to higher levels of agility and faster delivery by applying hard earned lessons from over a decade of process leadership and experience with Scrum.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love fast-paced startup environments, and helping grow organizations from infancy to maturity, with multiple
          successful startup exits under my belt as a founding employee of Springboard Retail
          (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/global-payments-acquires-springboard-retail-2--b175aca9">acquired by Global Payments</a>),
          and early employee of Iora Health (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/one-medical-is-buying-iora-health-2021-6">acquired by One Medical</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/business/amazon-one-medical-deal.html">later Amazon</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am working on building the API first EHR and practice management platform to shape how healthcare is delivered everywhere outside the hospital at <a href="https://www.gethealthie.com/">Healthie</a>! (<a href="https://www.gethealthie.com/careers">we're hiring!</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always looking for my next challenge! If you have an opportunity you think I might be excited about, please don't
          hesitate to reach out!
